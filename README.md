# SunnyLand
A jumping game developed using the SunnyLand assets from the Unity asset store.

The objective of the game is to jump on the incoming Eagles heads, which scores the player points.
As the score increases, the spawn rate as well as the chasing velocity of the enemy Eagles increase.

The enemies use Astarpathfinding to locate and follow the player around.
